      <p>
        Instructional designer by day and illustrator by night, Micah loves making books with pictures. 
        His first published comic appeared in his high school newspaper monthly, the Francis Howell North Star, 
        and ran from 1993 to 1996. He lives with his wife and 2 children in St. Louis, Missouri, 
        U.S.A. His passion is to raise awareness of rare genetic diseases like ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), 
        the one his daughter has, in order to find better treatments and increase community support. 
        As such, he has been donating his illustration fees to charities that help fund medical research. 
        His current project, A-T Walker, is primarily about his daughter&apos;s story, and he has published 2 issues of it so far.

        He&apos;s an active contributor and member of the Comics Accountability Club and the Indie Comix Collection. 
        His work has been published monthly in Scarfff Comics Newspaper since 2022. He&apos;s also been published in Freaky Magazine 
        (Andrew Goldfarb), Not My Small Diary (Delaine Derry Green), and Amazing Little Comics (Bantam House Publishing). 
        But by far, his favorite thing is to handmake his own little zines and mini comics.
